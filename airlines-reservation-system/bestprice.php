        <h1><b>BEST PRICE GUARANTEE (BPG)</b></h1>

<br>
<p class="pwrite">In the unlikely event that you find a lower rates on Flight Expert or on any other Bangladeshi based website for the same itinerary within 24 hours of booking with Flight Expert, we will either cancel your current itinerary and provide you a full refund, or refund you the entire difference in price. You will need to provide documentation that all the elements of the lower offer, including, without limitation, the departure and arrival dates and locations, airline, class, fare, cancellation policy, hotel room, hotel rate, car class and any other material conditions are the same as the itinerary you booked with us and available for booking online. Once we've verified that the information provided meets the requirements of the BPG, we will process a full refund of the price difference between the lower offer and the price of the itinerary you booked with us, or, at your option, cancel the itinerary you booked with us and refund to you the entire amount paid. The following offers are not subject to this Best Price Guarantee: Military, Student, Government, Tour Operator Fares, Bulk Rate or an airline's "Web Only" fare. Please see complete Best Price Guarantee terms and conditions for full details.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Notifying Flight Expert of a Best Price Guarantee Claim</b></h3>
<br>
<p class="pwrite">You must email us at sales@flightexpert.com along with competitor's offer, name of competitor, and screenshots of flights actually available to be booked from a reputable Bangladesh website within twenty-four (24) hours after your Flight Expert booking to make a claim under the Best Price Guarantee. The lower rate must be available for booking at the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service representatives.
    <br>
    The Best Price Guarantee is available only if the lower priced offer matches exactly each and every element present in itinerary booked with us, - such as same, specific carrier or provider (including same class of service and refund policy), - the exact same dates and times of travel or service, the same airfare class, hotel room type, car class and any other material conditions as booked through Flight Expert. The comparison must be with the same product stand-alone through another website. The Best Price Guarantee is not available for bookings on websites where the carrier booking details are unknown until after purchase, such as an auction website or a website offering opaque fares. You must meet all requirements imposed by the lower price offer (if any), including, without limitation, residency, regional and age-related requirements. The interpretation given by Flight Expert to these rules is final and binding.
Comparison rates must be available to the general public online. The Best Price Guarantee applies only to prices both advertised and available to the general public on a Bengali/English-language website. For example, this does not include rates offered on membership program websites, corporate discounts or rates; group, charter, rewards program, incentive, meeting, convention, consolidator or interline prices; prices obtained via auction or similar process; or prices available only by using a coupon or other promotion not offered to the general public. In ordered to be considered by Flight Expert, the lower rate may not come from a website where you call to get the rate, or from an e-mail that you received.</p>
